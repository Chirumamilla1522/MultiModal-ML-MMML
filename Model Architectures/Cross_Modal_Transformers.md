# Cross-Modal Transformers in Multimodal ML

## Introduction to Cross-Modal Transformers

Transformers have revolutionized natural language processing and are now being adapted for multimodal tasks. Cross-modal transformers process data from multiple modalities, allowing for joint learning and cross-modal attention mechanisms.

## Architecture Overview

- **Multi-Head Attention**: Mechanism that allows the model to focus on different parts of the input across modalities.
- **Cross-Attention Layers**: Layers where attention is computed across different modalities.
- **Position Encoding**: Encoding the position of elements in sequences, adapted for different modalities.

## Applications

- **Image-Text Retrieval**: Matching images with their corresponding textual descriptions.
- **Video-Text Generation**: Generating descriptive text from video sequences.
- **Multimodal Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzing sentiment by combining text, audio, and video.

## Implementation Guide

- **Step 1**: Encode each modality using modality-specific encoders.
- **Step 2**: Feed encoded representations into a cross-modal transformer.
- **Step 3**: Apply cross-attention to integrate information across modalities.
- **Step 4**: Output the integrated representation for downstream tasks.
