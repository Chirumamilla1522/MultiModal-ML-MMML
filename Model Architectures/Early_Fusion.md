# Early Fusion Models in Multimodal ML

## What is Early Fusion?

Early Fusion refers to the process where data from different modalities is combined before being fed into the model. This approach allows the model to learn a joint representation from the start.

## Advantages

- **Joint Learning**: The model learns correlations between modalities from the beginning.
- **Simplicity**: Easier to implement as it requires fewer separate models.

## Disadvantages

- **Overfitting**: Higher risk due to combining raw data.
- **Modality Imbalance**: Difficult to manage when one modality dominates in terms of information content.

## Implementation Example

- **Step 1**: Preprocess data from all modalities.
- **Step 2**: Concatenate feature vectors from each modality.
- **Step 3**: Feed the combined vector into a neural network.
