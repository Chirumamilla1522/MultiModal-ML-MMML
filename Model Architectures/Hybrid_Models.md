# Hybrid Models in Multimodal ML

## What is a Hybrid Model?

Hybrid models combine elements of both early and late fusion. They may perform some level of joint representation learning at an intermediate stage while keeping modality-specific models.

## Advantages

- **Balanced Learning**: Leverages joint learning while maintaining modality-specific features.
- **Scalability**: Can adapt to new modalities more easily than early fusion.

## Disadvantages

- **Complexity**: More complex to design and tune.
- **Computationally Intensive**: Higher computational requirements due to multiple stages.

## Implementation Example

- **Step 1**: Preprocess and extract features for each modality.
- **Step 2**: Perform early fusion on some modalities, followed by individual processing.
- **Step 3**: Combine outputs using late fusion techniques.
