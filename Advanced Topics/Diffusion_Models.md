# Diffusion Models in Multimodal ML

## Introduction to Diffusion Models
Diffusion models are a class of generative models that gradually transform a simple distribution (like Gaussian noise) into complex data distributions. They are particularly powerful in modeling high-dimensional data.

## Applications
- **Image Generation**: Generating high-quality images from noise.
- **Multimodal Translation**: Translating between modalities, such as generating images from text.
- **Data Augmentation**: Creating synthetic data to improve model robustness.

## Implementation Guide
- **Step 1**: Define the diffusion process by setting up noise schedules and transitions.
- **Step 2**: Train the model by minimizing the difference between the forward and reverse processes.
- **Step 3**: Generate data by sampling from the learned distribution and applying the reverse diffusion process.
