# Feature Engineering in Multimodal ML

## Text Features

- **N-Grams**: Capturing sequences of words to provide context.
- **TF-IDF**: Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency to assess the importance of words.
- **Embeddings**: Using pre-trained models like BERT for dense, contextual embeddings.

## Image Features

- **CNN-Based Features**: Leveraging pretrained CNNs like ResNet or VGG to extract deep features.
- **Edge Detection**: Using techniques like Canny edge detection for shape analysis.
- **Color Histograms**: Quantifying the distribution of colors.

## Audio Features

- **MFCCs**: Representing the short-term power spectrum of sound.
- **Spectrograms**: Visual representations of the spectrum of frequencies in a sound.
- **Chroma Features**: Pitch class profiles that capture harmonic content.

## Feature Selection

- **Correlation Analysis**: Identifying and removing highly correlated features.
- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**: Reducing dimensionality while preserving variance.
- **Feature Importance**: Using models like Random Forests to rank feature importance.
