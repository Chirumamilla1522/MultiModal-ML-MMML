# Basics of Multimodal Machine Learning

## What is Multimodal Machine Learning?

Multimodal Machine Learning involves the integration and analysis of data from multiple modalities, such as text, images, audio, and video. This allows for more comprehensive models that can understand and generate richer, contextually-aware results.

## Why Multimodality?

The real world is inherently multimodal. For example, humans communicate through language (text/speech), body language (images/video), and emotions (audio). Combining these modalities can lead to more robust AI systems.

## Key Applications

- **Cross-Modal Retrieval**: Retrieving relevant information across different data types.
- **Multimodal Translation**: Translating content between modalities, like generating images from text.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzing sentiment using text, facial expressions, and tone of voice.

## Challenges

- **Data Alignment**: Ensuring that data from different modalities is aligned correctly.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extracting meaningful features from each modality.
- **Model Complexity**: Balancing complexity with performance in multimodal models.
