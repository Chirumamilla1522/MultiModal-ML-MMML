## **Introduction**

Multimodal Machine Learning (ML) refers to the development of models that can process and learn from data across multiple modalities, such as text, image, audio, and video. The ability to leverage diverse data types is crucial for creating more robust and accurate models, especially in complex tasks like cross-modal retrieval, multimodal translation, and fusion.

### **Key Concepts**

- **Feature Extraction**: Techniques for deriving meaningful features from different data types.
- **Data Fusion**: Combining information from multiple modalities.
- **Modality Alignment**: Ensuring consistency across different data types.

## **Data Handling**

Handling data from multiple modalities poses unique challenges. This section covers:

- **Preprocessing Techniques**: Standardization, normalization, and handling missing data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracting and selecting the most relevant features from text, images, audio, etc.

## **Model Architectures**

Explore different architectures used in Multimodal ML:

- **Early Fusion Models**: Combine data at the input level.
- **Late Fusion Models**: Combine outputs from separate models.
- **Hybrid Models**: Utilize a combination of both early and late fusion techniques.

## **Advanced Topics**

Dive into advanced topics that push the boundaries of Multimodal ML:

- **Generative Models**: Understand and implement diffusion models and GANs in a multimodal context.
- **Cross-Modal Retrieval**: Techniques to retrieve relevant information across different modalities.
- **Self-Supervised Learning**: Methods to learn robust representations without labeled data.
